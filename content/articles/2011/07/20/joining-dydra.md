title: "Joining Dydra"
---

With jubilance, I'd like to announce that I have officially joined the
[Dydra team][] as a Developer Evangelist.

  [dydra team]: http://dydra.com/about

Anyone who knows me professionally knows that I love working in open-source,
whether it’s creating, contributing to or even just talking about software.  I
enjoy the fraternity, the absence of egos, and the recognition that a line of
code is worth a thousand words. In the coming months I will be working very
closely with the open-source community, aiming both to demonstrate to
developers the power of our platform, and to harvest ideas and feedback for
the product itself. I’ll also be taking care of the client SDKs, initially
focusing on Python and JavaScript (my fortes).

Aside from being able to work on such a revolutionary product, it’s a joy to be
on a team with some of the most intelligent and talented people I know—and I’m
being sincere.
