title: "Bureaucratic Breakdown"
---

My math teacher, who I admire greatly, showed me a small document he’d written a
while ago detailing the first signs of what he called ‘executive complexity’.
It’s a list of 8 recognizable symptoms which show that your organization (be it
a business, a school or a project) could be dealing with what he referred to as
a ‘Bureaucratic Breakdown’:

The Invisible Decision
:   No-one knows how or where decisions are made (there is no transparency).

Unfinished Business
:   Too many tasks are started but very few carried through to the end.

Co-ordination Paralysis
:   Nothing can be done without checking with a host of interconnected units.

Nothing New
:   There are no radical ideas, inventions or lateral thinking—a general lack of
    initiative.

Pseudo-problems
:   Minor issues become magnified out of all proportion.

Embattled Centre
:   The centre battles for consistency and control against local/regional units.

Negative deadlines
:   The deadlines for work become more important than the quality of the work
    being done.

In-tray Domination
:   Individuals react to inputs—i.e. whatever gets put in their in-tray—as
    opposed to using their own initiative (the difference between being reactive
    and proactive).

Overall, the culture becomes less responsive to the environment and less capable
of changing or adapting. It appears impressive but is out of touch, and often
out of control. These symptoms can accompany a general movement towards the
expansion, consistency, conformity, comparability, control and centralization of
the organization.

I found it very interesting to read this (I’m reproducing it here almost
word-for-word). I’m lucky enough to be working with a
[fantastic group of people](http://fantastichq.com), and we’re very open and
honest with each other. For me, reading my teacher’s thoughts on this sort of
‘corporate culture’ gave me something of an insight into the issues which
individuals in large organizations have to deal with on a daily basis. The thing
that struck me most was that all of these phenomena are emergent—they seem to
arise out of a collective will to obey (or lack of will to disobey) the system
rather than the behavior and decisions of any single individual.
