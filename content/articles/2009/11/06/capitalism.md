title: "Capitalism, or Something Unlike It?"
---

This is my response to an article in Forbes by Sramana Mitra, entitled
“[Capitalism’s Fundamental Flaw](http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/05/innovation-ayn-rand-intelligent-technology-capitalism.html)”.

It’s interesting that the author chooses the banking crisis as an example of the
‘fundamental flaw of capitalism’. No other industry on Earth is subject to as
much tacit government intervention and taxation, through the government monopoly
on the issue of currency, the institutionalized fraud of the fractional reserve
system, and inflation.

A (probably false) anecdote is brought to mind by this, actually. The bank
robber [Willie Sutton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Sutton), when asked
by a reporter why he robbed banks, reputedly replied “because that’s where the
money is.” False or not, it seems fitting that governments would adopt a similar
policy. And most importantly, with Willie as it is with governments, it’s not
the bank’s money they take. It’s **yours**.

It’s very easy for a government with a monopoly on a currency to begin an
inflationary death spiral. The methods are many: fractional reserve banking (in
any form), actual money printing, ‘quantitative easing’ or lowering of reserve
requirements are all ways to ‘increase the money supply’. Once the inflation is
set into motion, it is impossible to stop without incurring a catastrophic
economic recession. Since politicians are elected in the short-term, they decide
to continue with the short-term benefits (but long-term damages) of inflation. A
quote from Macbeth seems unnervingly relevant: ”I am in blood stepp’d in so far
that should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o’er.” In his
documentary series ‘Free to Choose’, Milton Friedman notes that inflation is
comparable to alcoholism; to paraphrase, it’s fun in the beginning, bad later
on, and increasingly difficult to give up ‘cold turkey’ the longer you continue.

Many people I speak to today still don’t understand how currencies go into
hyperinflation. The recent case of Zimbabwe illustrates this perfectly. It seems
*insane* that a government could allow such rampant inflation to occur, doesn’t
it? And yet the situation still continued to descend rapidly into chaos, until
people gave up on Zimbabwe dollars and
[started using gold instead](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2009/feb/11/zimbabwe-gold-panning-starvation-food).
Of course, this is the nature of inflation. The easy credit made available
through governmental economic policies in the U.S.A. and Europe have created a
similar environment, albeit a [boiling
frog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog) if ever there was one.

So how does this relate to the article I was originally responding to? Well, the
author’s main gripe is that the majority of capital in our so-called ‘free
market economy’ (which, incidentally, hasn’t been free since
[December 23, 1913](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act)) seems to
gravitate towards the speculators and market players rather than the innovators
and creators of value.

I can’t find much fault with her assessment, but I think the finger is being
pointed in the wrong direction. Where do you think speculators get their initial
investment capital from? It’s all **credit**. Speculators earn large amounts of
money through leverage (i.e. borrowing large amounts of money to turn a good
investment into a great one), and this leverage is provided by banks with a
license to print money, thanks in no small part to the fractional reserve
system. And of course, with the government monopoly on currency through legal
tender laws, this basically has everyone *except* the banks and government bent
over a financial barrel.

The gist of my argument is that the speculator problem is completely a
consequence of the government-controlled economy. The first instinct most people
have is to blame capitalism for the recent economic issues, but a closer,
rational inspection exposes who is really at fault here.
