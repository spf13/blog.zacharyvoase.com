  This post is written in the second-person, addressed to myself. I’m publishing
  it in the hopes of creating some extrinsic motivation through peer pressure.

  It might just be helpful to you, if you’re dealing with the same problems as
  me. Note that I’m an omnivore, but if you’re a vegan or otherwise observe a
  special diet then you’ve probably done more research than I have anyway.

Nutrition is about consuming (in the form of food) the raw materials you need to
survive. Over millions of years, your ancestors developed methods of extracting
and processing those materials from the bodies of animals and plants in your
environment. These methods were ‘designed’ for conditions of scarcity, yet
subsistence is no longer an issue. You are programmed to eat whatever you can
get, but due to the abundance of energy-rich food, you’ve stored the excess as
adipose tissue. Once upon a time, this behaviour allowed your
g’g’g’g’g’great-grandparents to outlive their peers. Now, it will probably
consign you to an early grave.

Being overweight/obese sucks for a variety of reasons. It’s not sexually
attractive, it greatly increases your risk of several life-threatening diseases
(including stroke, cardiopathy, cancer, diabetes and friends), it makes it hard
to find nice clothes that fit you, it impairs your general fitness (to the point
where it’s hard to run up a flight of stairs without losing your breath)—the
list is enormous. However, it’s a problem that can be solved, by fixing your
nutritional habits (commonly known as your **diet**).


## Low-hanging fruit

Stop eating **shit**. ‘Shit’ here includes:

*   Chocolate
*   Cake
*   Fries
*   Potato Chips
*   Milkshakes
*   Fast food (in general)
*   Ice Cream
*   Candy
*   Soda (regular, diet or otherwise)
*   Peanut Butter
*   Donuts
*   Frappaccinos (or any drink containing a metric fuck-tonne of cream)
*   Anything deep-fried

You get the gist. Most of these foods just appeal to your primal instinct to
consume sugar, but provide no essential nutritional value. I’m not saying cut
the fun stuff out *entirely*—life would suck if I couldn’t have a can of Coke
now and then—but don’t consider it a valid form of **nourishment**.


## Drinking

Water is perhaps the most nutritious substance you can consume—and you should
consume lots of it. Cordial is acceptable if the tap water in your area is
especially nasty, but it’s really not ideal. Bottled water is a rip-off, and in
blind taste tests is typically indiscernable from tap water.

Alcohol is fun in moderation. I don’t like getting drunk, and I don’t like
hangovers, so I have at least one glass of (tap) water or soft drink between
every alcoholic drink. Also, in most bars and clubs, tap water is free.


## Fruit

Most fruits have been artificially selected for sweetness (i.e. sugar content)
over hundreds of years, so I prefer to get most of my plant intake from
vegetables. Still, it’s better than the refined sugar found in most foods.


## Vegetables

Eat lots of green vegetables. Go for variety, to get the right amounts of all
the different vitamins and minerals you need. Starchy veg like potatoes should
be avoided for their high energy content. Favor raw over steamed, steamed over
baked, and baked over boiled.


## Meat

Most meats are OK. Consume lean cuts of meat, and if you prefer meat-based
products (such as sausages, burgers, nuggets or bacon), it’s far better to pay
more money for higher quality. If cost is an issue, just eat less, or buy a raw
cut of meat and prepare the dish yourself.


## Dairy

In general, dairy products (milk, butter, cream, cheese) are high in fats, so
consume them in moderation. Don’t cut them out entirely, because they’re good
sources of calcium, protein and vitamin D.


## Maize (Corn) and Wheat

These two plants are relatively recent additions to the human diet, yet both are
surprisingly pervasive throughout the food supply. Followers of the
[Paleo diet][] opine that, from an evolutionary standpoint, human beings are
ill-adapted to deal with such a high proportion of maize- and wheat-based
foodstuffs in the diet. I’m inclined to agree; eat less bread and pasta, and
check the labels of food for large quantities of cornstarch (often used as a
filler in ground meat products like sausages).

## Takeout

The general standard of takeout (in the UK, at least) is horrendous—we’ve all
experienced oily curry, greasy pizza and salty rice and noodles. The quality is
there if you’re willing to fork out the cash (again, just eat less), but most of
the time it’s not worth it.


## Eating locally

Lots of people prefer to eat only locally-produced food, mainly due to concerns
about climate change. I have no such reservations myself, although I’ve found
that supermarket meat tends to be of a lower quality, less fresh and more
expensive than meat from the local butcher. Likewise, local greengrocers and
markets usually offer very good fruit and vegetables at impossibly low prices,
and local fishmongers offer great seasonal seafood, often caught only a couple
of days before.

The undeniable allure of the supermarket tends to be about convenience; the food
is always more expensive and of worse quality than what you can get elsewhere.
For certain exotic products there’s sometimes no choice, in which case the
quality over quantity rule applies.


### Provenance

Tied into this idea of local eating is **provenance**. When you buy and prepare
food yourself, you know exactly what’s in it, and where it came from. You can
even trace it back to the farm it was grown on. This makes it a lot harder for
harmful ingredients to penetrate your diet, and also makes for a rather
satisfying cooking and eating experience.


## Exercise

How you spend your energy is just as important as how you obtain it. You need
daily exercise, even if it’s just walking around. Aim to get a good mixture of
cardio and resistance; by building muscle you’ll speed up the rate at which your
fat deposits are consumed. It’s advisable to consult a professional who can help
you plan a thorough exercise régime.
