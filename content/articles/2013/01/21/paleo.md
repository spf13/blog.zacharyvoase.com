title: "What Paleo Means (To Me)"
---

I want to clarify what I mean when I say ["I eat Paleo"](http://zacharyvoase.com/2013/01/21/diet/#paleo).

'Paleo' is a framework for generating *falsifiable* hypotheses about nutrition,
based on the principle that the foods human beings adapted to eat over millions
of years of evolution are definitely safe, and that for new additions to our
diet, there exists a burden of proof to demonstrate safety.

It is strongly desirable for these hypotheses to be tested through randomized
intervention studies (rather than epidemiological observations); *in vitro*
results should be taken with a pinch of salt but may still provide useful
suggestions for further study.

It is recognized that safety of a food is not defined solely by short-term
toxicity or lack thereof, but with respect to the entire organism: chronic
effects on the serum and hormonal responses (e.g. glucose and insulin), organs
(e.g. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), systemic inflammation, the immune
system, gut flora, interactions with other components of the diet, et cetera.
We realize that practical studies can't be perfect, but we can interpret the
evidence we get, and individually decide whether to take the risk.

'Paleo' completely defies the typical 'fad diet' labelâ€”because it's just
science-based nutrition.
