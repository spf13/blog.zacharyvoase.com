title: "The Dangers of Reification"
---

In a 1987 interview for Woman’s Own magazine, Margaret Thatcher famously
quipped that “there is no such thing as society”. This quote caused a lot of
controversy, such that Thatcher addressed it in her 1993 autobiography, *The
Downing Street Years*:

> They never quoted the rest. I went on to say: There are individual men and
> women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except
> through people, and people must look to themselves first. It’s our duty to
> look after ourselves and then to look after our neighbour.  My meaning, clear
> at the time but subsequently distorted beyond recognition, was that society
> was not an abstraction, separate from the men and women who composed it, but
> a living structure of individuals, families, neighbours and voluntary
> associations.

It’s true that *society* is an abstraction—an oft useful one, but an
abstraction nonetheless. And therefore when we say ‘it is the responsibility of
*society* to do XYZ,’ we must bear in mind that we are talking about the
components which make up that abstraction: the individuals. When we do err in
our use of it, we are committing the [Fallacy of
Reification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)).  I find it a
lot easier to use standard terms of art from the field of logic rather than
explain the point every time.

In any dialogue, we hope to improve our own argument by having a skilled
opponent who can point out these mistakes. But we also have to be our own
critics. As libertarians, as much as we like to point out the fallacy of
reifying *society* when committed by left-leaning thinkers, we also have to
avoid the trap of referring to *the market* as a reified entity.

There is no such thing as the market. There are individual actors, and there
are businesses. The business is reified through the concept of the legal
corporation, which is a little more concrete, but the corporate veil remains a
thin one. When we say “the market will fix this problem”, what we mean to say
is that businesses and individuals will rise to a challenge because it is in
their economic interest to solve it. But this is never guaranteed, and assuming
that a ‘market’ even exists for a given solution is dangerous.

I’m not arguing in favour of the government running everything; I remain a
lover of economic freedom and I believe that a small government is better than
a large one. But there have been many tragic situations where a government has
cut-and-run from a project they couldn’t manage effectively, expecting ‘the
market’ to pick it up and instantly solve all the issues. The simple
libertarian recommendation of “let the market fix it” needs to be rethought in
terms of establishing robust ‘starting variables’ for common pool resource
management systems that allow a market to grow—a phrase which here means
‘encourage motivated economic agents to sustainably compete over resources’.

As participants of a debate, we must be aware of the language we use to think
and talk about these matters, so that we can improve the quality of our
discourse and bring better arguments to the table, even if that means admitting
to a few past mistakes.
